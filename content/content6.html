                I have experience in a wide range of programming, stretching from strictly procedural languages like x86 assembly, BASIC, and C, all the way to object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, Java, and Python, and many others.

                <strong>Present day:</strong><br>
                In 2020 when online school was getting a big push, I realized I could finally go back to school and pursue my degree in Software Engineering. This would help be bring my passion for writing code out of the personal project space and into the professional space. Five years later, here I am, now with a degree in Software Engineering, ready to help create innovative software solutions!
