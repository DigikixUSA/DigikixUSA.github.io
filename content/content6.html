            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                I am a Junior Software Engineer with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering and a long-standing technical background in programming.
                While my professional career has been in regulated manufacturing environments, software development has been a consistent focus
                for me over many years through personal projects and structured learning.
            </p>

            <p>
                My experience spans both procedural and object-oriented programming, including C, C++, C#, Java, Python, and JavaScript.
                I have built applications using Spring Boot, Android, Unity, and modern web technologies, and I am comfortable working
                across the full development lifecycle—from design and implementation to debugging and refinement.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2020, I formalized my software background by returning to school and completing my degree in Software Engineering.
                That experience strengthened my understanding of software design principles, data persistence, testing,
                and professional development practices.
            </p>

            <p>
                I bring a disciplined engineering mindset developed from years of work in regulated technical environments,
                with an emphasis on clear documentation, structured problem-solving, and maintainable code.
                I am actively pursuing junior software engineering opportunities where I can contribute and continue growing professionally.
