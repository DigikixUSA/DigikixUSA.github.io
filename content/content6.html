            I have experience in a wide range of programming, stretching from strictly procedural languages like x86 assembly, BASIC, and C, all the way to object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, Java, and Python.

            I started writing code back in the mid-90s and kept it as a hobby since. Writing code without modern IDEs on hardware where every clock cycle is valuable, teaches you a lot about writing efficient and stable code. For example, even though we no longer have any need to code bit-shifting instead of plain multiplication or division, understanding the thought process behind old optimizations like this, and understanding exactly why a pointer is different than an array, provide a deep fundamental understanding that provides an excellent foundation upon which high-level languages can be understood more thoroughly, and new languages can be learned quickly.

            In 2020 I was working for a company that was using very outdated hardware and software (Windows NT 4.0 & Visual Studio 6.0!) for testing their products. These old machines took a long time to run tests, and as the guy who ran these tests, I began to think about how things could be improved. Given my background and knowledge, I took it upon myself, in my free time, to write a modern replacement that would provide speed, stability, greater functionality, as well as the ability to maintain it. I presented this to my manager who was not only very impressed but frustrated that the company couldnâ€™t officially use it since I was not one of their engineers. They also had a requirement that any engineers hired have a degree minimum. This is where I realized I needed to pursue a degree and make this sort of work my profession. Four years later, here I am, now with a degree in Software Engineering, ready to help create innovative software solutions!
