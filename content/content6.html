                <strong>Languages:</strong><br>
                I have experience in a wide range of programming, stretching from strictly procedural languages like x86 assembly, BASIC, and C, all the way to object-oriented languages such as C++, C#, Java, and Python, and many others.

                <strong>History:</strong><br>
                I started writing code back in the mid-90s and kept it as a hobby since. Writing code without modern IDEs on hardware where every clock cycle is valuable, teaches you a lot about writing efficient and stable code. For example, even though we no longer have any need to code bit-shifting instead of plain multiplication or division, understanding the thought process behind old optimizations like this, and understanding exactly why a pointer is different than an array, provide a deep fundamental understanding that provides an excellent foundation upon which high-level languages can be understood more thoroughly, and new languages can be learned quickly.

                <strong>Present day:</strong><br>
                In 2020 when online school was getting a big push, I realized I could finally go back to school and pursue my degree in Software Engineering. This would help be bring my passion for writing code out of the personal project space and into the professional space. Five years later, here I am, now with a degree in Software Engineering, ready to help create innovative software solutions!
