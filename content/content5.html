    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

    <p>
        My background includes 13+ years in regulated and technical environments. While my recent roles are in manufacturing quality,
        they developed core strengths that translate directly to software engineering: structured problem-solving, documentation discipline,
        cross-functional collaboration, and ownership of quality outcomes.
